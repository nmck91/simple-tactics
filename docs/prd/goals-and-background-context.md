# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Provide volunteer youth soccer coaches (ages 5-11) with instant access to expert-level tactical knowledge through a pre-built tactics library
- Translate adult tactical concepts into child-comprehensible explanations with age-appropriate visual themes (Superhero mode for 5-7, Professional mode for 9-11)
- Deliver zero-friction tactical explanation tool accessible in 3 taps with no login required
- Build coach confidence and reduce pre-game anxiety through ready-made, engaging tactical content
- Increase kid engagement and tactical understanding through animated, fun visual presentations
- Achieve 500+ active volunteer coaches and 40%+ weekly retention within 6 months of launch
- Establish open-source community with 10+ contributors and 100+ GitHub stars within first year

## MVP Timeline

**Target Duration:** 3-4 months for production-ready MVP

**Epic Breakdown:**
- **Epic 1 (Foundation & Visual Tactics Library):** 4-5 weeks
  - Project setup, CI/CD, 3-4 core tactics with static visualization
  - Deliverable: Browsable tactics library on mobile

- **Epic 2 (Animations, Multi-Format, & Dual-Theme System):** 6-8 weeks
  - Animation engine, full 8-12 tactics library, format adaptation, dual themes
  - Deliverable: Complete animated, themed, multi-format tactics experience

- **Epic 3 (Customization, PWA, & Launch Readiness):** 3-4 weeks
  - Player customization, offline PWA, performance optimization, documentation, beta testing
  - Deliverable: Production-ready MVP with community launch

**Milestones:**
- **Month 1:** Epic 1 complete - static tactics viewable on mobile
- **Month 2-3:** Epic 2 complete - animated dual-theme system operational
- **Month 3-4:** Epic 3 complete - MVP launched to beta testers and community

**Contingency:** Timeline assumes consistent development effort. Open-source volunteer pace may extend to 5-6 months. Phased launch recommended: Beta at Month 3, public launch at Month 4-6.

## Background Context

Grassroots youth soccer relies heavily on volunteer coaches who often lack formal coaching experience or the mental library of age-appropriate explanations that experienced coaches build over years. These volunteers face a translation barrier—they may understand tactics intellectually but don't know HOW to explain pressing, passing patterns, or defensive positioning to 5-11 year-olds in engaging, child-friendly language. This gap leads to coach burnout, player disengagement, and missed tactical development during critical foundational years.

Existing solutions (CoachNow, TacticalPad, TeamSnap) are elite-focused professional drawing tools requiring coaching expertise to use effectively. They assume users already know what to draw and how to explain it—presenting volunteers with a "blank canvas problem" that overwhelms rather than empowers. Simple Tactics fills this systemic gap by functioning as a translation layer and expert knowledge library, providing pre-built tactics with dual visual themes, animations, and relatable metaphors. By optimizing for emotional success metrics (confidence, calm, fun) rather than tactical execution perfection, Simple Tactics democratizes coaching expertise for the underserved grassroots community that market forces have ignored.
