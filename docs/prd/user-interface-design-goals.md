# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Simple Tactics delivers a **delightful, confidence-building experience** that transforms tactical explanation from an anxiety-inducing challenge into an opportunity for connection and fun. The interface prioritizes **instant comprehension over customization**, presenting coaches with beautiful, ready-to-use tactical content within seconds of opening the app. The design balances **playful engagement for young children** with **professional credibility for coaches**, creating an experience that feels both fun and authoritative. Every interaction is optimized for the **sideline environment**: bright, high-contrast visuals for outdoor readability, large touch targets for distracted coaches, and a flow so simple it works even with kids crowding around the screen.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Visual-First Navigation:** Tactics presented as animated thumbnail previews in a scrollable grid—coaches recognize tactics visually rather than reading text menus
- **Tap-to-Animate:** Single tap on a tactic card triggers full-screen animation with controls (play/pause/restart) accessible via large, obvious buttons
- **Theme Toggle:** Prominent visual switcher (toggle or slider) between Superhero and Professional modes, with instant visual transformation of the entire interface
- **Drag-and-Drop Customization:** (Optional for MVP) Simple drag-to-assign player names to positions on the field
- **Swipe Gestures:** Swipe left/right to navigate between tactics; swipe up for format selection (5v5, 7v7, 9v9)
- **Always-Visible Defaults:** No blank states—every screen shows example content or helpful defaults reducing cognitive load

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

1. **Tactics Library Grid (Home)** - Visual grid of all available tactics with animated thumbnails, theme toggle, and format selector
2. **Tactic Detail View** - Full-screen animated field showing selected tactic with play controls, explanation text, and customization options
3. **Format Selector** - Simple picker for 5-a-side, 7-a-side, or 9-a-side (could be inline on home screen)
4. **Player Customization Panel** - Overlay or slide-in panel for assigning player names to positions
5. **Theme Preview/Switcher** - Visual comparison or instant switcher between Superhero and Professional modes (could be integrated into home screen header)
