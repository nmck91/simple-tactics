# Story 1.2: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Vercel Deployment

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated testing and deployment on every commit,
**so that** code quality is maintained and changes are immediately available for testing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this story, ensure the following are completed:

1. **GitHub repository created** for the project
2. **Vercel account created** (free tier: https://vercel.com/signup)
3. **Vercel CLI installed globally:** `npm install -g vercel`
4. **Vercel authenticated locally:** `vercel login` (confirms authentication successful)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on push to `main` and pull requests
2. CI workflow executes linting (`npm run lint`) and build (`npm run build`) steps
3. CI workflow fails if lint errors or build errors are detected
4. **Vercel project connected to GitHub repository with automatic deployments:**
   - Vercel account authenticated to GitHub
   - Repository selected in Vercel dashboard
   - Build settings configured (Framework Preset: Next.js, Build Command: `npm run build`, Output Directory: `out`)
5. Successful builds on `main` branch automatically deploy to production URL
6. Pull requests generate preview deployment URLs visible in GitHub PR comments
7. Vercel environment configured with appropriate build settings:
   - Node version: 18.x or 20.x
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `out` (Next.js static export)
   - Environment variables (if any): documented in `.env.example`
8. **Manual deployment tested:** Run `vercel` command locally to verify project deploys successfully before configuring GitHub Actions
9. **Production URL documented:** Production URL (e.g., `simple-tactics.vercel.app`) recorded in README.md for reference

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**From Story 1.1:**
- Next.js 14+ project initialized with static export mode
- TypeScript strict mode configured
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Project structure established
- npm scripts for `dev`, `build`, `lint` already exist

### CI/CD Architecture
**[Source: ui-architecture/project-structure.md#github-section]**

GitHub Actions workflow location: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Required workflow steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js (20.x)
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. Run linting (`npm run lint`)
5. Run build (`npm run build`)
6. Fail workflow if any step fails

**[Source: ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md#security-compliance]**

Additional CI steps to add in future stories:
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` (security vulnerabilities)
- License compliance check (Story 1.6+)
- Lighthouse CI (Story 1.7)

### Vercel Deployment Configuration
**[Source: ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]**

**Framework:** Next.js with static export mode

**Build Settings:**
- Framework Preset: Next.js
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `out` (Next.js static export output)
- Install Command: `npm install`
- Node.js Version: 20.x

**[Source: ui-architecture/template-and-framework-selection.md]**

**Static Export Mode:**
Next.js configured with `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js` generates static HTML/CSS/JS files to `/out` directory, compatible with any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)

**Disabled Next.js Features (acceptable for static export):**
- ❌ API routes (not needed for MVP)
- ❌ Middleware (CSP via Vercel headers instead)
- ❌ Image Optimization API (manual pre-build optimization)

### Vercel Integration with GitHub
**Automatic Deployments:**
- **Production:** Pushes to `main` branch → automatic production deployment
- **Preview:** Pull requests → automatic preview deployment with unique URL
- **Preview URL:** Appears as comment on PR from Vercel bot

**Build Process:**
1. Vercel detects push/PR via GitHub webhook
2. Clones repository
3. Runs `npm install`
4. Runs `npm run build`
5. Deploys `/out` directory to CDN
6. Returns deployment URL

### GitHub Actions CI Workflow Template

**[Source: ui-architecture/project-structure.md]**

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Check build output
        run: |
          if [ ! -d "out" ]; then
            echo "Build output directory 'out' not found"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Environment Variables
**[Source: ui-architecture/environment-configuration.md]**

**For MVP (Story 1.2):** No environment variables needed - everything is client-side static.

**Create `.env.example` as placeholder:**
```bash
# Future analytics endpoint (post-MVP)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_URL=https://analytics.simple-tactics.org

# Future API (post-MVP)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.simple-tactics.org
```

**Important:** Next.js static export only supports `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables (client-side only).

### Vercel CLI Commands
**Manual deployment:**
```bash
vercel          # Deploy to preview
vercel --prod   # Deploy to production
```

**Link project:**
```bash
vercel link     # Link local directory to Vercel project
```

**Environment variables:**
```bash
vercel env ls                    # List environment variables
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_VAR   # Add environment variable
```

### Production URL Format
Vercel automatically generates production URL:
- Pattern: `<project-name>.vercel.app`
- Example: `simple-tactics.vercel.app`
- Custom domains can be added later in Vercel dashboard

### Testing the CI/CD Pipeline

**Verification Steps:**
1. **CI Workflow:** Create PR with small change → CI runs → builds succeed
2. **CI Failure:** Create PR with lint error → CI fails → PR blocked
3. **Preview Deployment:** PR gets unique Vercel preview URL in comments
4. **Production Deployment:** Merge PR → automatic production deployment
5. **URL Access:** Visit production URL → app loads correctly

### Key Files to Create/Modify

**New Files:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template (placeholder)

**Modified Files:**
- `README.md` - Add production URL and deployment docs
- Potentially `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Document CI/CD process for contributors

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**[Source: ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]**

1. ❌ Forgetting to run `npm run build` locally before pushing (catches build errors early)
2. ❌ Using `npm install` in CI instead of `npm ci` (less deterministic)
3. ❌ Not testing preview deployments before merging
4. ❌ Bypassing CI with `--no-verify` on git hooks
5. ❌ Not documenting production URL for team members

### Testing

**[Source: ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]**

**Testing for Story 1.2 (CI/CD setup):**

**Manual E2E Testing:**
1. Test GitHub Actions workflow runs on PR
2. Test Vercel preview deployment creates unique URL
3. Test production deployment on merge to main
4. Test CI failure when lint/build errors exist
5. Verify deployment URLs are accessible

**No automated tests required** - this story is about infrastructure setup, validated by:
- CI workflow runs successfully
- Vercel deployments succeed
- URLs are accessible

**Future testing (Story 1.6+):**
- Add test step to CI workflow: `npm test`
- Add coverage reporting
